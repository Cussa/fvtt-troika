Torpor helps build post-mortem empathy by </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">causing the necromancer to temporarily die. Bodily functions are halted, </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">no food, water, or air is needed, and they are, by most vulgar definitions</span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">of the word, dead. The Spell lasts until ended by the wizard, who remains </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">vaguely aware of their surroundings to the extent of being conscious of </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">sound and movement but not of what is said or who is saying it. They still </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">take Damage from bodily abuse while under the effect and can indeed </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">become irretrievably dead.</span></p>",
