Blacksmithing, carpentry, painting, opera singing, anything like that. Roll Under the Skill if you want to do something that knowledge of this Skill would reasonably cover. A carpenter might be able to spot a weak bridge while a blacksmith could shoe a horse or an opera singer could identify an aria. Be flexible and reasonable. </span></p>",
